            kept me going , you went above and beyond, from negotiating the prices for the venue to 
            choosing the theme of my baby's birthday to all the ideas you were coming up with, it was 
            a pleasure to chat with you especially when you got so excited about what you were 
            planning for my little girl and updating me every step of the way, it was so lovely and

          <p class="quote">"I can't thank you both enough for making Dad's 70th birthday so 
            incredibly special! The room looked absolutely stunning-every detail was perfect, and 
            the effort you put into it truly showed. From the beautiful balloons, flowers, and floating 
            candles to the elegant mirrored runner, everything came together so beautifully. The 
            moustache theme was excellent & we all had such a giggle with it & complimented the photo 
            slideshow very well! Our guests absolutely loved their name cards and memento boxes, and we 
            had such a great laugh with the legend and funny memory cards-what a brilliant idea! It was 
            so much fun planning this with you, and the outcome was even better than I could have ever 
            imagined. We even managed to get quite a few of the balloons home! Thank you again for all 
            your creativity, communication and attention to detail. It was a night we will always 
            remember! If you ever need a testimonial or review, please let me know as more than happy 
            to provide this. Have a lovely rest of the weekend & thank you so much anain!"</p>

          <p class="quote">"Last weekend was truly magical, made even more special by the presence 
            of my dearest ones. For the décor, I knew exactly who to call Sharon of S.V Events 
            Planning & Decor. 
            I first met her while MCing at a friend's birthday party, where her welcome setup 
            caught my eye. The attention to detail was wow! We exchanged contacts, and I knew then 
            that when my own celebration came around, she would be the one. From start to finish, 
            Sharon's professionalism was outstandingcalm, respectful, and always with a bright, 
            warm smile. We had several meetings, each one leaving me reassured and inspired. She 
            even provided a beautiful mood board to guide the creative process. As an event host 
            myself, I picked up a thing or two from watching you in action. I truly admire your 
            artistic flair and flawless execution. Thank you, Sharon, for bringing the vision to 
            life so beautifully."</p>
